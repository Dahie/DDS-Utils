DDS-Utils are a selection of tools to work with DirectDrawSurfaces textures in Java.

Badds - Batch a DDS, Rescale and Batch-process DDS-files.
Radds - Review a DDS, Lightweight DDS-viewer
Dropps - Simple DDS-image-converter
DDSUtil - Wannabe-library for DDS-conversion

--------------

Each subproject has it's own project folder in the repository. 
I use eclipse to check each one out. The Tools require the DDSUtils-project in their buildpath.
