DDS-Utils are a selection of tools to work with DirectDrawSurfaces textures in Java.

Badds - Batch a DDS, Rescale and Batch-process DDS-files.
Radds - Review a DDS, Lightweight DDS-viewer
Dropps - Simple DDS-image-converter
DDSUtil - Wannabe-library for DDS-conversion

Each subproject has it's own project folder in the repository. 
I use eclipse to check each one out. The Tools require the DDSUtils-project in their buildpath.

History

The project stem from some hobby work I did in summer 2008. 
Out of boredom I wanted to be able to load DDS files in Java and write tools
for reviewing and processing in Java. This was my first own bigger java project and therefore
I'm sure there are things that can be nicer and I'm open for feedback and criticism.
